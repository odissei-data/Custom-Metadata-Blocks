datasetfieldtype.dansElsstClassification.description=A key term from the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST) that describes an important aspect of the Dataset.
datasetfieldtype.dansCessdaClassification.description=Indicates a broad, important topic selected from the CESSDA Topic Classification that the Dataset covers.
datasetfieldtype.dansUnitOfAnalysis.description=Basic unit of analysis or observation that this Dataset describes, such as individuals, families/households, groups, institutions/organizations, administrative units, and more.
datasetfieldtype.dansUniverse.description=Description of the population covered by the data in the file; the group of people or other elements that are the object of the study and to which the study results refer. Age, nationality, and residence commonly help to delineate a given universe, but any number of other factors may be used, such as age limits, sex, marital status, race, ethnic group, nationality, income, veteran status, criminal convictions, and more. The universe may consist of elements other than persons, such as housing units, court cases, deaths, countries, and so on. In general, it should be possible to tell from the description of the universe whether a given individual or element is a member of the population under study. Also known as the universe of interest, population of interest, and target population.
datasetfieldtype.dansTimeMethod.description=The time method or time dimension of the data collection, such as panel, cross-sectional, trend, time-series, or other.
datasetfieldtype.dansFrequencyOfDataCollection.description=If the data collected includes more than one point in time, indicate the frequency with which the data was collected; that is, monthly, quarterly, or other.
datasetfieldtype.dansSamplingProcedureCV.description=Type of sample and sample design used to select the survey respondents to represent the population.
datasetfieldtype.dansSamplingProcedureFreeText.description=Type of sample and sample design used to select the survey respondents to represent the population. May include reference to the target sample size and the sampling fraction.
datasetfieldtype.dansCollectionMode.description=Method used to collect the data; instrumentation characteristics (e.g., telephone interview, mail questionnaire, or other).
datasetfieldtype.dansResearchInstrument.description=Type of data collection instrument used. Structured indicates an instrument in which all respondents are asked the same questions/tests, possibly with precoded answers. If a small portion of such a questionnaire includes open-ended questions, provide appropriate comments. Semi-structured indicates that the research instrument contains mainly open-ended questions. Unstructured indicates that in-depth interviews were conducted.
datasetfieldtype.dansDataCollectionSituation.description=Description of noteworthy aspects of the data collection situation. Includes information on factors such as cooperativeness of respondents, duration of interviews, number of call backs, or similar.
datasetfieldtype.dansActionsToMinimizeLoss.description=Summary of actions taken to minimize data loss. Include information on actions such as follow-up visits, supervisory checks, historical matching, estimation, and so on.
datasetfieldtype.dansWeighting.description=The use of sampling procedures might make it necessary to apply weights to produce accurate statistical results. Describes the criteria for using weights in analysis of a collection. If a weighting formula or coefficient was developed, the formula is provided, its elements are defined, and it is indicated how the formula was applied to the data.
datasetfieldtype.dansResponseRate.description=Percentage of sample members who provided information.
